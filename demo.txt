I have attached:

1) A .txt file containing the blog part of  my dashboard
2) Images/screenshots of the current dashboard UI

Context:
- Built with Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui components
- React Hook Form
- Server Actions
- TypeScript

IMPORTANT:
For now, focus ONLY on the main dashboard page and its related components.
Ignore other dashboard sections — I will attach them later.

Your PRIMARY goal is to significantly improve the UI and visual design of the dashboard.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 MAIN PRIORITY: UI / UX IMPROVEMENT (80% focus)

Using the attached dashboard screenshots as reference:

1️⃣ Improve Overall Layout
- Improve spacing and alignment
- Improve content density
- Improve visual hierarchy
- Improve typography scale
- Improve card design
- Improve section separation
- Improve grid structure
- Improve sidebar/header if present

2️⃣ Responsiveness
- Make layout fully responsive
- Mobile-first approach
- Improve tablet layout
- Improve dashboard card stacking
- Improve tables on small screens
- Improve overflow handling

3️⃣ Visual Polish
- Use the Tailwind CSS styles defined at the bottom of the attached code
- Follow the design tokens and CSS variables
- Improve color usage
- Improve contrast
- Improve shadows
- Improve border usage
- Improve rounded corners
- Improve hover states
- Add subtle transitions
- Add loading skeletons where appropriate
- Add smooth animations (but keep professional and subtle)

4️⃣ shadcn/ui Optimization
- Use Cards properly
- Improve Tables styling
- Improve Dialogs
- Improve Form layout
- Improve Buttons and badge usage
- Improve empty states
- Improve loading states

Make it look:
- Modern
- Clean
- Professional
- Production-level SaaS quality

Do NOT remove any functionality.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 SECONDARY PRIORITY: Types & Logic Review (20%)

After UI improvements:

5️⃣ TypeScript Review
- Validate all types
- Fix unsafe types
- Remove any incorrect `any`
- Ensure forms match server action types
- Validate server action return types

6️⃣ Server Actions Review
- Ensure proper input validation
- Ensure error handling
- Improve type safety
- Improve return types
- Improve structure if needed

7️⃣ Logic Review
- Check business logic
- Check async handling
- Check form submission flow
- Identify potential bugs
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

---------------------------------------------------------------------

📦 OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)

- Provide FULL updated code for every file you modify.
- Do NOT provide partial snippets.
- Do NOT summarize only.
- Clearly label each file:

File: app/dashboard/page.tsx
(then full code)

File: components/dashboard/StatsCard.tsx
(then full code)

etc.

Even if only small changes were made, provide the FULL updated file.

If you create new components (recommended for better UI structure), provide their full code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

⚠️ IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

- Do NOT change the tech stack.
- Do NOT replace shadcn/ui.
- Do NOT simplify features.
- Do NOT remove functionality.
- Focus ONLY on dashboard page + its components.
- Follow the CSS styles defined at the bottom of the attached file.
- Use best modern Next.js App Router practices.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Start with:
1) A short visual/design critique of the current dashboard (based on the images).
2) Then provide improved file-by-file code.
3) Then list optional architectural suggestions at the end.

Assume this is production SaaS software and improve it to that standard.
